# Session Handoff — Coding_Agent

## Source of truth

GitHub repository: `afterburn25/Coding_Agent`

Future development sessions should begin by reading, in order:

1. `README.md`
2. `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
5. `MODEL_ROUTING.md`
6. `docs/IMAGE_MODULE_SPEC.md` when working on images
7. `docs/WEB_RESEARCH.md` when working on internet/browser capabilities

Do not reconstruct project state from chat memory when the repository can answer it. Update this handoff and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` before ending substantial development work.

## Current development baseline

- Stable baseline through v0.3 coding workflow.
- Active branch/worktree is now v0.4 development.
- v0.4 adds two new modular capability families without replacing existing coding-agent components:
  - Web research + optional full Chromium automation.
  - Local image generation/editing through an image-router/backend abstraction with ComfyUI as the first backend.
- Automated tests: **27 passing** at the time of this handoff.

## Completed before v0.4

- Chat-style local UI and backend.
- Automatic coding-model routing: utility, fast coder, primary coder, deep reasoner, reviewer, vision.
- Resource-aware model choice and escalation.
- Managed llama.cpp lifecycle and health recovery.
- Transactional patch editing.
- First-write checkpoints and task undo.
- Permission approvals with resumable exact tool calls.
- Verification detection/build-test execution.
- Reviewer model handoff.
- Persistent task ledger/project memory.
- Lightweight repository index.

## v0.4 work implemented in this session

### Web/internet tools

- `web_search` tool using a dependency-free research client.
- `fetch_url` tool for extracting readable text/JSON from web pages.
- `browser_run` tool backed by optional Playwright/Chromium.
- Separate permissions:
  - `network.read`
  - `browser.control`
- System prompt tells the agent to research the web when current external facts matter and to cite source URLs actually used.

### Image architecture

Created `localcodeagent/image/` with:

- `types.py` — image model/request/job/routing dataclasses.
- `router.py` — automatic image operation and model selection.
- `backend.py` — stable `ImageBackend` abstraction.
- `comfyui.py` — dependency-free ComfyUI HTTP adapter.
- `runtime.py` — optional managed ComfyUI launch/health/stop/recovery.
- `workflow.py` — JSON API-workflow loading and `${variable}` substitution.
- `catalog.py` — local image model discovery.
- `profiles.py` — reusable subject/character profiles.
- `policy.py` — adult consent records and high-risk image safeguards.
- `manager.py` — queue/history/routing/backend/resource coordination.

### Image agent tools

Registered tools:

- `generate_image`
- `edit_image`
- `inpaint_image`
- `outpaint_image`
- `remove_background`
- `upscale_image`
- `create_image_variations`
- `list_image_models`
- `load_subject_profile`

### Image workspace

Added `/image.html` with:

- conversational prompt/editor
- drag/drop image upload
- reference strip
- Auto/manual image model selector
- operation selector
- quality and resolution controls
- generation count and seed controls
- subject profile selector
- advanced negative prompt / LoRA / strengths / outpaint / transparency / upscale / refinement controls
- real-person reference flag
- job progress display
- cancellation
- generated-image gallery

### Shared GPU resource coordination

`RuntimeManager` can now release managed coding LLMs when an image model needs VRAM and restore them after the image job, depending on image resource settings. External runtimes are never terminated by this mechanism.

## Current model defaults

Image model profiles are configuration templates, not bundled weights:

- `qwen-image-2.1` — quality/editing preference, up to 10 configured reference images, transparency flag, configurable ComfyUI workflow.
- `flux2-klein-4b` — fast preview/draft preference, up to 4 configured references, configurable ComfyUI workflow.

No image weights are downloaded automatically yet.

## Known gaps / next executable steps

1. Add tested ComfyUI API workflow templates for the selected Qwen-Image-2.1 and FLUX.2 Klein local node stacks.
2. Add Image Model Manager download/install/verify/remove/repair APIs and UI.
3. Add LoRA library metadata, compatibility checks, multi-LoRA injection into workflows, and preview UI.
4. Add mask editor and dedicated before/after comparison UI.
5. Add background-removal and upscaler backend/workflow adapters instead of assuming a configured ComfyUI workflow handles them.
6. Make the main chat poll image job completion and render finished images inline with Edit/Variation/Upscale/Open controls.
7. Add WebSocket/SSE streaming for chat tokens, tool events, and image-generation progress.
8. Add persistent browser sessions and richer browser selectors/snapshots.
9. Add local GitHub tool integration to the agent itself (separate from ChatGPT's development connector).
10. Add model-performance telemetry to improve auto-routing based on actual task outcomes.

## Testing command

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Expected at this handoff: `27 tests` passing.
