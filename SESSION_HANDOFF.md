# Session Handoff — Coding_Agent

## Source of truth

GitHub repository: `afterburn25/Coding_Agent`

Future development sessions should begin by reading, in order:

1. `README.md`
2. `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
5. `MODEL_ROUTING.md`
6. `docs/IMAGE_MODULE_SPEC.md` when working on images
7. `docs/RESEARCH_SYSTEM.md` for research/ranking/repair-loop work
8. `docs/WEB_RESEARCH.md` when working on low-level internet/browser capabilities

Do not reconstruct project state from chat memory when the repository can answer it. Update this handoff and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` before ending substantial development work.

## Current development baseline

- Stable baseline through v0.3 coding workflow.
- Active branch/worktree is now v0.5 development.
- v0.4 adds two new modular capability families without replacing existing coding-agent components:
  - Web research + optional full Chromium automation.
  - Local image generation/editing through an image-router/backend abstraction with ComfyUI as the first backend.
- Automated tests: **64 passing** after the research/verification-repair and image-workflow-validation milestone.

## Completed before v0.4

- Chat-style local UI and backend.
- Automatic coding-model routing: utility, fast coder, primary coder, deep reasoner, reviewer, vision.
- Resource-aware model choice and escalation.
- Managed llama.cpp lifecycle and health recovery.
- Transactional patch editing.
- First-write checkpoints and task undo.
- Permission approvals with resumable exact tool calls.
- Verification detection/build-test execution.
- Reviewer model handoff.
- Persistent task ledger/project memory.
- Lightweight repository index.

## v0.4–v0.5 work implemented

### Web/internet tools

- `web_search` tool using a dependency-free research client.
- `fetch_url` tool for extracting readable text/JSON from web pages.
- `browser_run` tool backed by optional Playwright/Chromium.
- Separate permissions:
  - `network.read`
  - `browser.control`
- System prompt tells the agent to research when current/version-specific facts matter and to cite source URLs actually used.
- `localcodeagent/research/` adds repository-first preflight, environment/package inspection, knowledge-gap planning, source ranking, cache/session history, official-domain mapping, and untrusted-source handling.
- Research tools cover technical topics, docs, GitHub/upstream issues, exact errors, API lookup, release notes, package versions, and cached summaries.
- GitHub research prefers the versioned REST API, reads optional auth from `GITHUB_TOKEN` (configurable env-var name), caches API evidence, and falls back to web search.
- Verification failures can re-enter a bounded diagnose/research/fix/retest loop.

### Image architecture

Created `localcodeagent/image/` with:

- `types.py` — image model/request/job/routing dataclasses.
- `router.py` — automatic image operation and model selection.
- `backend.py` — stable `ImageBackend` abstraction.
- `comfyui.py` — dependency-free ComfyUI HTTP adapter.
- `runtime.py` — optional managed ComfyUI launch/health/stop/recovery.
- `workflow.py` — JSON API-workflow loading and `${variable}` substitution.
- `catalog.py` — local image model discovery.
- `profiles.py` — reusable subject/character profiles.
- `policy.py` — adult consent records and high-risk image safeguards.
- `manager.py` — queue/history/routing/backend/resource coordination.
- `library.py` — model component verification, explicit download/repair/remove jobs, LoRA metadata, and generated ComfyUI extra-model paths.

### Image agent tools

Registered tools:

- `generate_image`
- `edit_image`
- `inpaint_image`
- `outpaint_image`
- `remove_background`
- `upscale_image`
- `create_image_variations`
- `list_image_models`
- `load_subject_profile`

### Image workspace

Added `/image.html` with:

- conversational prompt/editor
- drag/drop image upload
- reference strip
- Auto/manual image model selector
- operation selector
- quality and resolution controls
- generation count and seed controls
- subject profile selector
- advanced negative prompt / LoRA / strengths / outpaint / transparency / upscale / refinement controls
- real-person reference flag
- job progress display
- cancellation
- generated-image gallery
- Image Model Manager verify/install/repair/remove controls and install progress
- LoRA discovery/metadata display

### Shared GPU resource coordination

`RuntimeManager` can now release managed coding LLMs when an image model needs VRAM and restore them after the image job, depending on image resource settings. External runtimes are never terminated by this mechanism.

## Current model defaults

Image model profiles are configuration templates, not bundled weights:

- `qwen-image-2.1` — quality/editing preference, up to 10 configured reference images, transparency flag, configurable ComfyUI workflow.
- `flux2-klein-4b` — fast preview/draft preference, up to 4 configured references, configurable ComfyUI workflow.

No image weights are downloaded automatically yet.

## Current additions after the original v0.4 handoff

- ComfyUI workflows are now validated as API-format before loading large models.
- Image Model Manager can import API-format workflows into configured operation slots.
- Image jobs now expose structured friendly error messages plus collapsed technical diagnostics.
- Required ComfyUI nodes are checked before generation.
- Main chat renders/polls image jobs inline and exposes Edit/Variation/Upscale/Save actions.
- `config.example.json` is synchronized with the current Qwen/FLUX component layouts and research settings.
- Image workspace now imports and assigns API-format ComfyUI workflow JSON per model/operation.
- Import rejects normal ComfyUI UI exports with an explicit Export (API) instruction, validates before write, writes atomically, confines paths to `workflows/image`, and limits imports to 10 MB.
- `remove_background` now resolves both the new canonical workflow key and legacy `background_removal` configs.
- LoRA selections are resolved only from installed local files, respect enabled state/version/family compatibility/max-count/strength bounds, and are recorded on image jobs.
- Selected LoRAs require explicit workflow template slots before generation, preventing a UI selection from being silently ignored.
- Subject profiles now apply saved references, preferred model, generation defaults, and assigned LoRAs automatically.
- Image workspace can filter/use/enable/disable discovered LoRAs.
- Image job errors are classified into stable codes with user-facing messages and collapsed technical details instead of raw exception strings.
- Local mask editor now paints/erases/fills/inverts and uploads masks through the existing local image-upload route for `mask_path`.
- Before/after workbench can compare a finished edit and reuse generated outputs as the next source image.

## Known gaps / next executable steps

1. Use the Image workspace workflow manager to import and test real ComfyUI API-format workflows for the selected Qwen-Image-2.1 and FLUX.2 Klein local node stacks.
2. Add dedicated background-removal and upscaler adapters/workflows.
3. Add WebSocket/SSE streaming for chat tokens, tool events, research events, and image-generation progress.
4. Add persistent browser sessions and richer browser selectors/snapshots.
5. Add local GitHub integration to the agent itself (clone/issues/PR/CI) behind explicit permissions.
6. Add model-performance and research-outcome telemetry to improve automatic routing.

## Testing command

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Expected at this checkpoint: `64 tests` passing.
